# EMIT

## Naming and History

The naming of EMIT standed for Energy MonIToring as it originally aimed at monitoring software energy consumption. It became a monitoring system for connected instruments when the latter have exclusively been embedded as MQTT-based powermeters for remote and continuous monitoring purpose. It finally is a true open-source, service-oriented and big-data-scalable SCADA application (for supervisory control and data acquisition).
